Before starting
In this module we have seen how to use the gitflow methodology for the development of an application and we have developed a web application sketch (cryptobook). It is about adding functionality and format to the web application.
The application is in the next repo
https://github.com/pigmonchu/criptobook.git
To continue with it, you must follow these steps
Steps to download cryptobook and disassociate from git.
1. Clone the repository above in your development folder.
     $> cd dev
     $> git clone https://github.com/pigmonchu/criptobook.git
2. Delete the information related to version control in cryptobook on your computer
$> cd cryptobook
$> rm -rf .git in windows rd / s / q .git
3. Create a new repo git in your cryptobook folder
     $> git init
     $> git add.
     $> git commit -m "Initial commit"
4. Create a new repo git on github (call it cryptobook or whatever you want)
5. Associate the repo of github with yours in local
     $> git remote add origin https://github.com/<your_user>
     <tu_repo> .git
     $> git push -u origin master
From there you can develop the practice and give the address of your repo in the form.

Modification of the cryptobook application
It is about adding functionality to the application as it is and of formatting the transaction modification form (putting it in the same way as the transaction registration form).
1. Create transaction erasure function
2. Format transaction modification form

Function erased from transaction Starting from the main screen (http: // localhost: 5000 /)
  !
Add a DELETE button next to the EDIT button
This button, by the design of our application, will invoke the address http: // localhost: 5000 / nuevocompra [GET].
Modify that route in views.py so that
1. if CLEAR has been pressed, delete that transaction in the data file data / transactions.dat
2. Return the initial screen and show one less record.

Modification of the format of the modification form to leave it as the registration form
The transaction registration form looks like this

Modify the appropriate template to leave the modification equal to the creation
Steps to start
Once you have the repository you will have to install all its dependencies that appear in the requirements.txt file
With virtual environment
If you prefer to use a virtual environment remember to do it like this:
1. From the VSC terminal and with the cryptobook folder already open (inside the
project), execute
     $> python -m venv venv
2. Activate the virtual environment (it will take a moment to create it) executing
$>. venv / bin / activate On windows $> venv \ Scripts \ activate
3. You should appear (venv) in front of the cursor in the terminal. If you do install the dependencies with
$> pip install -r requirements.txt
Start to develop normally. If you want you can use sourceTree and the gitflow methodology, but it is not necessary
