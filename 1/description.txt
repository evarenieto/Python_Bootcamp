1. Write a program that analyzes a text.
Write a program in python that reads a text file and returns us in another file (stats.txt) with the following data
● Number of Words
● number of vowels
● number of consonants
● number of digits (0-9)
● number of other characters
● number of capitals
● number of lowercase
● number of paragraphs
In addition the program will correct the following errors of the original text
● commas, colons, dots, and semicolons between two words should always
go in this order word1, word2. That is to say with a blank space after the
coma.
● Two white spaces in a row are not allowed. If you want to tabulate you should use
tabulator \ t. Four spaces followed corresponds to a tabulator
● After point and followed it must be capitalized.
The corrected text will be recorded in a third file correction.txt
Restrictions
● The program will ask us for the name of the file to be processed or it will do so as an input parameter. Either option is worth
● The program will generate two new files with the names stats.txt and correction.txt with the specifications above
